## What is an LEI?

A **Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)** is a unique 20-character alphanumeric code that identifies legal entities participating in financial transactions globally. For Canadian businesses engaged in international trade, securities, or derivatives trading, having an LEI has become increasingly important.

## Why Canadian Businesses Consider LEI Registration

When I started researching business identifiers for cross-border transactions, I discovered that many Canadian companies are finding value in having a globally recognized identifier. Here's what I learned about why businesses look into [LEI registration](https://www.tnvlei.com/en-CA):

- **Counterparty Verification**: Enables partners to verify your business identity
- **Regulatory Readiness**: Positions your business for compliance requirements
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrates commitment to transparency in financial dealings

## Understanding the LEI System

The LEI system is overseen by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), which maintains a public database of all registered entities. Authorized entities accredited by GLEIF handle the registration and maintenance of these identifiers worldwide.

The identifier contains information about:
