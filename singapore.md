## What is an LEI?

A **Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)** is a unique 20-character alphanumeric code that identifies legal entities participating in financial transactions globally. For Singapore businesses, particularly those involved in derivatives trading or international financial activities, having an [lei number](https://www.tnvlei.com/en-SG) has become increasingly relevant.

## Why Singapore Businesses Consider LEI Registration

When researching business identifiers for financial transactions, I discovered that many Singapore companies are finding value in having a globally recognized identifier. Here's what I learned about why businesses explore [lei registration](https://www.tnvlei.com/en-SG/process):

- **Global Recognition**: The identifier is recognized across international financial markets
- **Counterparty Verification**: Enables partners to verify your business identity
- **Regulatory Readiness**: Positions your business for compliance requirements
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrates commitment to transparency in financial dealings

## Understanding the LEI System

The LEI system is overseen by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), which maintains a public database of all registered entities. Authorized entities accredited by GLEIF handle the registration and maintenance of these identifiers worldwide.

The identifier contains information about:
- Legal name of the entity
- Registered address (linked to ACRA records)
- Entity status
- Ownership structure
